### :man_technologist: About Me :
  <!--
Beginner Web Developer. Currently improving my skills in JavaScript and
frameworks, PHP, databases and back-end.
Equipped with background knowledge of accounting, data management, and
dashboards.
Proficient in various technologies, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript (jQuery,
AngularJS, and Vuejs), PHP, Git/Github, and VBA.
Able to effectively self-manage during independent projects, as well as collaborate
in a team environment. Always looking for opportunities to bring more efficiency to
tasks and learn new topics.

I decided to change my occupation of over 11 years of working in Maintenance and Electrical Engineering to start a new career in Front-End Web Development.

I've been working and dedicated long enough time to learn about Web Development and become a great professional. I'm ready to acquire new knowledge and skills and Iâ€™m certain that joining your team is a benefit for both sides. Iâ€™m ready for long-time cooperation.

My name is Matheus Santana Golembiewski, from Brazil. Nice to meet you!
I started my professional carrer as an accountant and worked in that field for 4 years. I used to work a lot with Excel and do some repetitive tasks... But, after I learned about VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) my mind exploded!
